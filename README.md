# chess-java
The pieces can move like in regular chess except the move en-passant wich is missing. To move the pieces you drag and place the piece and if it is a legal
move the piece will then move there. To castle you move the king two spaces left or right depending on what side you want to castle. You win the game by
capturing the other king. The board will then reset and point will be awarded.
